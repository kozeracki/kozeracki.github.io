**Purpose**  
The purpose of this website is to create a personal public website.

**AI Usage Note**  
This website and its initial Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) documentation were drafted with the help of an AI coding assistant (Cursor / GPT). The AI was used to generate the first version of the HTML/CSS layout and to outline and draft SDLC-related content, which was then reviewed and edited by the student for accuracy and alignment with course requirements.
