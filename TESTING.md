## Testing Checklist – Personal Website (Intro to AI)

Use this checklist to verify the static GitHub Pages site works as expected.

- [ ] **Deployed site loads**: Open the deployed URL (`https://kozeracki.github.io/`) and confirm the page renders (name header, sections, and styling).
- [ ] **Navigation works**: Click the top navigation links (**About**, **Projects**, **Learning**) and confirm each jumps to the correct section on the same page.
- [ ] **Broken links check**: Click every link on the page (GitHub link, any mail link) and confirm none produce a 404 or error page.
- [ ] **Projects section present**: Confirm the **Projects** section displays “Project 1” and “Project 2: Java Script Game” placeholders and the GitHub link is visible.
- [ ] **Mobile/phone test**: Open the deployed site on a phone (or use browser responsive mode) and confirm the layout stacks cleanly, text is readable, and no content is cut off horizontally.
- [ ] **Cross-browser smoke test**: Load the deployed site in at least two browsers (e.g., Safari + Chrome) and confirm layout and fonts look consistent.
- [ ] **Accessibility quick check**: Confirm headings are visible and section labels are clear; verify link text is readable and has sufficient contrast against the background.
- [ ] **Static requirement check**: Confirm the page is still static (served as `index.html` with CSS only) and does not rely on JavaScript to display core content.
